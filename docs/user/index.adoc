== Getting started with the new API

NOTE: If you are looking to use the JSR-107, aka `javax.cache` API, you should start by reading
      link:107{outfilesuffix}[the Ehcache 3.x JSR-107 Provider page]

WARNING: *This is still a work in progress*. While it represents the API as it exists today, the final version will be represented in the Ehcache 3.0 OSS Beta.

=== Configuring it all in Java

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../impl/src/test/java/org/ehcache/GettingStarted.java[lines=43..68]
----

<1> Static method `org.ehcache.CacheManagerBuilder.newCacheManagerBuilder` that returns a new `org.ehcache.CacheManagerBuilder`
    instance;
<2> Use the builder to register a pre-configured `Cache` to be created when we `.build()` the actual `CacheManager`.
    The first `String` argument is the alias used to interact with the `Cache` through the `CacheManager`; the second
    argument is `org.ehcache.config.CacheConfiguration` to configure the `Cache`. We use the static
    `.newCacheConfigurationBuilder()` method on `org.ehcache.config.CacheConfigurationBuilder` to create a default config;
<3> Finally, invoking `.build()` returns a fully instantiated and initialized `CacheManager` we can use.
<4> We can retrieve the `preConfigured` aliased `Cache` we declared in step 2. For type-safety, we ask for both key and
    value types to be passed in. If these differ from the ones we expect, the `CacheManager` throws a `ClassCastException`
    early in the application's lifecycle. It also guards the `Cache` from being polluted by random types.
<5> The `CacheManager` can also be used to create new `Cache` as needed. Just as in step 2, it requires passing in an
    alias as well as a `CacheConfiguration`. The instantiated and fully initialized `Cache` added will be returned and/or
    accessed through the `CacheManager.getCache` API.
<6> We can now use the newly added `Cache` to store and ...
<7> ... retrieve data.
<8> We can also `CacheManager.remove()` a given `Cache`. The `CacheManager` will not only remove it's reference to the
    `Cache`, but will also close it. The `Cache` releases all locally held transient resources (such as memory).
    References to this `Cache` become unusable.
<9> A new feature of Ehcache 3.0 is the ability to create `StandaloneCache` instances, i.e. ones not managed by a `CacheManager`;
<10> As there is nothing that manages them, it is up to you to `StandaloneCache.init()` them, prior to using them.
<11> In order to release all transient resources (memory, threads, ...) a `CacheManager` provides to `Cache` instances
     it manages, you have to invoke `CacheManager.close()`, which in turns closes all `Cache` instances known at the time.
<12> In the same vein, a `StandaloneCache` requires you to `StandaloneCache.close()` it explicitly. The `CacheManager.close()`
     in step #11, did not affect our `StandaloneCache` in any way.

=== It wouldn't be Java without _some_ XML

You can create a XML file to configure a `CacheManager`:

[source,xml]
----
<config
    xmlns:xsi='http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance'
    xmlns='http://www.ehcache.org/v3'>

  <cache alias="foo"> <!--1-->
    <key-type>java.lang.String</key-type> <!--2-->
    <capacity>2000</capacity> <!--3-->
  </cache>

  <cache-template name="myDefaults"> <!--4-->
    <key-type>java.lang.Long</key-type>
    <value-type>java.lang.String</value-type>
    <capacity>200</capacity>
  </cache-template>

  <cache alias="bar" usesTemplate="myDefaults"> <!--5-->
    <key-type>java.lang.Number</key-type>
  </cache>

  <cache alias="simpleCache" usesTemplate="myDefaults" /> <!--6-->
</config>
----

<1> Declares a `Cache` aliased to `foo`
<2> The keys of `foo` are declared as type `String`; since the value type is not specified, the values will be of type `Object`.
<3> `foo` is declared to hold up to 2,000 entries before it starts evicting
<4> `<cache-template>` elements let you create an abstract configuration that further `<cache>` configuration can then _extend_
<5> `bar` is such a `Cache`.   `bar` uses the `<cache-template>` named `myDefaults` and overrides its `key-type` to a wider type.
<6> `simpleCache` is another such a `Cache`.  It uses `myDefaults` configuration for its sole `CacheConfiguration`.

Refer to the link:xml{outfilesuffix}[XML documentation] for more details on the XML format.

In order to parse an XML configuration, you can use the `XmlConfiguration` type:

[source,java]
----
final URL myUrl = this.getClass().getResource("/my-config.xml"); // <1>
Configuration xmlConfig = new XmlConfiguration(myUrl); // <2>
CacheManager myCacheManager = CacheManagerBuilder.newCacheManager(xmlConfig); // <3>
----

<1> Obtain a `URL` to your XML file's location
<2> Instantiate an `XmlConfiguration` passing the XML file's URL to it
<3> Using the static `org.ehcache.CacheManagerBuilder.newCacheManager(org.ehcache.config.Configuration)` lets you
    create your `CacheManager` instance using the `Configuration` from the `XmlConfiguration`

== Current release

We released Ehcache 3.0 Alpha on December 12, 2014. It
contains everything (and more) to use the JSR-107 API with Ehcache as the underlying provider.

The https://github.com/ehcache/ehcache3/releases/tag/v3.0.0.Alpha[release notes] contain the links to the documentation
to help you get started.

== Current development & next release

We are now working on the next milestone, aka https://github.com/ehcache/ehcache3/milestones/OSS%20Beta[OSS Beta] :
All the features we want to port from the existing Ehcache 2.x line, exposed using the new API.
This includes things not covered by the JSR-107 spec, such as _WriteBehind_, _DiskPersistence_, _EvictionListener_ et al.

See the https://github.com/ehcache/ehcache3/milestones[Milestones on GitHub] for more details on the current status.
