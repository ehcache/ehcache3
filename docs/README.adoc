= How to work on documentation

The documentation is all in link:http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/[asciidoc].

== Build

The documentation is built with

  ./gradlew :docs:asciidoctor

You will then find the result in `docs/build/asciidoc/user`.

== Live reload

To get live reload while editing the documentation, you need two shells.

In the first one, do a continuous buid of the documentation.

  ./gradlew -t :docs:asciidoctor

In the second launch the live reload.

  ./gradlew -t :docs:livereload

The local port will be printed on the console. The usual URL is link:http://localhost:35729[http://localhost:35729].

== Add a section

1. Create a new adoc file
2. Copy the header used in the other pages to it
3. Reference it in `menu.adoc` and `index.adoc`
