Ehcache 3.0.0 has been released!  In this post I would like to demonstrate how to use it as Spring's caching implementation.  This article will show you how to use Ehcache 3.0.0, Spring 4.2 and the JSR-107 annotations to build a simple Spring web application.  I have also included some background reading for those of you that would like to read more in depth on the subject matter.
