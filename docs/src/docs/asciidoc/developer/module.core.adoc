== Core Module

Contains the +ServiceLocator+, as well as core SPI interfaces.

=== `CacheManager` and its `Cache` instances

The `CacheManager` not only acts as a repository of `Cache` instances, but it also lifecycles them. The `CacheManager` is also responsible for lifecycling `Service` instances. These `Service` instances are provided by the `CacheManager` for its `Cache` instances to use. The `Cache` and `Service` instances can look up any `Service` by it's type by querying the `ServiceLocator`.

==== The `ServiceLocator`

Every `CacheManager` has its own `ServiceLocator` instance. The `ServiceLocator` acts as a repository of concrete `Service` which can then be looked up by type. The `Service` instances it knows about are the ones provided to it at `CacheManager` construction time. `Service` instances can be injected directly, but will more generally be declared for use by providing a matching `ServiceConfiguration` to the `CacheManagerBuilder`. Not all `Service` are necessarily required to be user facing (through one of their `ServiceConfiguration` for instance). If a requested `Service` can't be found, it'll be looked up using Java's `ServiceLoader` facility from the classpath.

The `ServiceLoader` fallback for `Service` lookups can be used by the end-user, but is expected to be used mainly by _anyone_ building an *Ehcache Distribution* (i.e. a so-called _Ã¼berjar_ created by some mean from all the different modules that composes it). The idea is to only couple different `Service` to the minimal and the strictly required level.

=== Configuration types

==== Minimal configurations

In order to create a `CacheManager`, you need to configure `CacheConfiguration` for each and every `Cache` instance you want to use. You also may need to configure some additional `Service` instances one or some of your `Cache` need. Whether configured directly at the `CacheManager` level, or at the `Cache` level, a given `ServiceConfiguration` will be used by a single `Service` instance. But the `Service` itself may configure itself further for a given `Cache`.

==== The `interface Store.Provider extends Service` as an example

There will be only one `Store.Provider` instance registered for that type that the `CacheManager` will lookup using the `ServiceLocator` when creating a `Cache` instance. The `Store.Provider` acts as a _factory_ for `Store` instances. That factory may delegate to specialized implementations of `Store.Provider` it _knows_ about (e.g. `OnHeapStoreProvider`, `DiskStoreProvider`, ...) by looking at the `Store.Configuration` it's been asked to configure the `Store` instance for.

What that `Store.Provider` instance it'll be can either be specified by injecting one directly into the `ServiceLocator` backing up the `CacheManager` to create the `Cache` instances. Or have it fallback to the _classpath_ of the application to resolve one. Where the `ServiceLoader` facility is only resorted to, if none injected instance could be found.
