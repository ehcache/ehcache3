=== Configuration

+Configuration+ and +CacheConfiguration+ aren't used to create +CacheManager+ and +Cache+ instances, respectively. Instead they are used to reflect the configuration currently in use by a given +CacheManager+ or +Cache+.

To instantiate new +CacheManager+ or +Cache+, you should use +CacheManagerBuilder+ or +CacheBuilder+ instances instead.
