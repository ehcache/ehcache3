== Basic Terms

=== Cache
Wiktionary defines a cache as _a store of things that will be required in the future, and can be retrieved rapidly_.
A cache is a collection of temporary data that either duplicates data located elsewhere or is the result of a
computation. Data that is already in the cache can be repeatedly accessed with minimal costs in terms of time and
resources.

=== Cache Entry
A cache entry consists of a key and its mapped data value within the cache. This is also sometimes referred to as a
_cache mapping_.

=== Cache Hit
When a data entry is requested from cache and the entry exists for the given key, it is referred to as a cache hit
(or simply, a _hit_).

=== Cache Miss
When a data entry is requested from cache and the entry does not exist for the given key, it is referred to as a cache
miss (or simply, a _miss_).

=== Cache Access
Any time a data entry is requested from cache, the cache is _accessed_ no matter if the outcome was a _hit_ or a _miss_.

=== Hit Ratio
It is the ratio of cache hits over cache accesses, or _hits_ / _accesses_. For instance, a cache accessed 100 times
that hit 90 times has a hit ratio of: _90_ / _100_ or _0.9_ or _90%_.

=== Miss Ratio
It is the ratio of cache misses over cache accesses, or _misses_ / _accesses_. For instance, a cache accessed 100 times
that missed 30 times has a miss ratio of: _30_ / _100_ or _0.3_ or _30%_. It is the corollary of _hit ratio_ as
_hit ratio_ + _miss ratio_ is always _1.0_ or _100%_.

=== System-of-Record (SoR)
The authoritative source of truth for the data. The cache acts as a local copy of data retrieved from or stored to the
system-of-record (SOR). The SOR is often a traditional database, although it might be a specialized file system or some
other reliable long-term storage. It can also be a conceptual component such as an expensive computation.

=== Eviction
The removal of entries from the cache in order to make room for newer entries (typically when the cache has run out of
data storage capacity).

=== Expiration
The removal of entries from the cache after some amount of time has passed, typically as a strategy to avoid stale
data in the cache.

=== Off-Heap
When large caches put too much pressure on the GC, a common resort is to store the caches' contents _off-heap_, i.e:
still in the memory of the JVM process but out of reach of the garbage collector. The off-heap implementation Ehcache
uses is https://github.com/Terracotta-OSS/offheap-store/[Terracotta's port] of
http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/html/malloc.html[dlmalloc] to Java backed by NIO direct ``ByteBuffer``s.

=== Hot Data
Data that has recently been used by an application is very likely to be accessed again soon.  Such data is considered
_hot_.  A cache may attempt to keep the _hottest_ data most quickly available, while attemping to choose the
_least hot_ data for eviction. Following the Pareto Distribution, you ideally want all your hot data to fit into your
caches.

=== Pareto Distribution
According to https://www.statisticshowto.datasciencecentral.com/pareto-distribution/[Data Science Central], _the Pareto
distribution is a skewed distribution with heavy, or “slowly decaying” tails (i.e. much of the data is in the tails)_.
This is more commonly known as the 80% / 20% rule.
The entire concept of caching is based on the Pareto Distribution, as caches are only effective when their hit ratio
reaches a certain level, i.e.: as a general rule of thumb 80% of your transactions should be served with cached data and
the remaining 20% by data coming from other, more expensive means.
