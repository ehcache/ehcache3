== Basic Terms

=== Cache
Wiktionary defines a cache as _a store of things that will be required in the future, and can be retrieved rapidly_.
A cache is a collection of temporary data that either duplicates data located elsewhere or is the result of a
computation. Data that is already in the cache can be repeatedly accessed with minimal costs in terms of time and
resources.

=== Cache Entry
A cache entry is a key and its mapped data value within the cache.

=== Cache Hit
When a data entry is requested from cache and the entry exists for the given key, it is referred to as a cache hit
(or simply, a _hit_).

=== Cache Miss
When a data entry is requested from cache and the entry does not exist for the given key, it is referred to as a cache
miss (or simply, a _miss_).

=== System-of-Record (SoR)
The authoritative source of truth for the data. The cache acts as a local copy of data retrieved from or stored to the
system-of-record (SOR). The SOR is often a traditional database, although it might be a specialized file system or some
other reliable long-term storage. It can also be a conceptual component such as an expensive computation.

=== Eviction
The removal of entries from the cache in order to make room for newer entries (typically when the cache has ran out of
data storage capacity).

=== Expiration
The removal of entries from the cache after the passing of some amount of time, typically as a strategy to avoid stale
data in the cache.

=== Hot Data
Data that has recently been used by an application is very likely to be accessed again soon.  Such data is considered
_hot_.  A cache may attempt to keep the _most hot_ data most quickly available, while attemping to choose the
_least hot_ data for eviction.
