== Introduction


endif::notBuildingForSite[]

[IMPORTANT]
==========================
Ehcache 3.1+ jar no longer contains the transaction related code.
This is now available through a different binary:
[source,xml]
----
<groupId>org.ehcache</groupId>
<artifactId>ehcache-transactions</artifactId>
----
==========================

NOTE: Ehcache 3.1 added clustering support but this is not yet compatible with transactional caches.

[[limitations]]
== What is supported and what are the limitations?

Ehcache supports caches that work within the context of an XA transaction controlled by a Java Transaction API (JTA) transaction manager.
Within this context, Ehcache supports the two-phase commit protocol, including crash recovery.

* Bitronix Transaction Manager 2.1.4, which is an open source project hosted on GitHub, is the only tested transaction manager.
Other transaction managers may work but have not yet been tested.

* Read-Committed is the only supported isolation level.

* The isolation level is guaranteed by the use of the `Copier` mechanism.
When no copiers are configured for either the key or the value, default ones are automatically used instead.
You cannot disable the `Copier` mechanism for a transactional cache.

* Accessing a cache outside of a JTA transaction context is forbidden.

* There is no protection against the ABA problem.

* Everything else works orthogonally.

== Configuring it all in Java

=== The simplest case

The simplest possible configuration is to configure a cache manager as transactionally aware by using the provided Bitronix transaction manager integration.

This `INFO` level log entry informs you of the detected transaction manager:

[listing%nowrap]
----
INFO org.ehcache.transactions.xa.txmgr.btm.BitronixTransactionManagerLookup - Using looked up transaction manager : a BitronixTransactionManager with 0 in-flight transaction(s)
----

Here is an example:

[source%nowrap,java,indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir38}/transactions/src/test/java/org/ehcache/docs/transactions/xa/XAGettingStarted.java[tag=testSimpleXACache]
----

<1> First start the Bitronix transaction manager. By default, Ehcache will auto-detect it but will throw an exception during the cache manager initialization if BTM isn't started.
<2> Configure the cache manager such as it can handle transactions by having a `TransactionManagerProvider` loaded and configured to use Bitronix.
<3> Register a cache the normal way.
<4> Give it the resources you wish.
<5> Add a `XAStoreConfiguration` object to make the cache XA transactional.
You must also give the cache a unique `XAResource` identifier as some transaction managers require this.
<6> Begin a JTA transaction the normal way.
<7> Work with the cache the normal way, all operations are supported.
Note that concurrent transactions will not see those pending changes.
<8> Commit the JTA transaction.
Other transactions can now see the changes you made to the cache.

=== Configuring your transaction manager

While only the Bitronix JTA implementation has been tested so far, plugging-in another one is possible.

You will need to implement a `org.ehcache.transactions.xa.txmgr.provider.TransactionManagerLookup` and make sure you understand
its expected lifecycle as well as the one of the `org.ehcache.transactions.xa.txmgr.provider.LookupTransactionManagerProvider`.

If such a lifecycle does not match your needs, you will have to go one step further and implement your own `org.ehcache.transactions.xa.txmgr.provider.TransactionManagerProvider`.

=== XA write-through cache

When a XA cache is configured in write-though mode, the targeted SoR will automatically participate in the JTA transaction context.
Nothing special needs to be configured for this to happen, just ensure that the configured `CacheLoaderWriter` is configured to work with XA transactions.

[source%nowrap,java,indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir38}/transactions/src/test/java/org/ehcache/docs/transactions/xa/XAGettingStarted.java[tag=testXACacheWithWriteThrough]
----

<1> First start the Bitronix transaction manager.
By default, Ehcache will auto-detect it but will throw an exception during the cache manager initialization if BTM isn't started.
<2> Configure the cache manager such as it can handle transactions by having a `TransactionManagerProvider` loaded and configured to use Bitronix.
<3> Register a cache the normal way.
<4> Give it the resources you wish.
<5> Add a `XAStoreConfiguration` object to make the cache XA transactional.
You must also give the cache a unique `XAResource` identifier as some transaction managers require this.
<6> Add a `CacheLoaderWriter` configuration.
This one is a mocked SoR backed by a map for illustration purpose that is filled with {1L,"eins"} key/value pair at startup.
<7> Begin a JTA transaction the normal way.
<8> The cache is empty at startup, so the `CacheLoaderWriter` will be called to load the value.
<9> Update the value.
This will make the `CacheLoaderWriter` write to the SoR.
<10> Commit the JTA transaction.
Other transactions can now see the changes you made to the cache and the SoR.

=== Transactional scope

A XA cache can only be accessed within a JTA transaction's context.
Any attempt to access one outside of such context will result in `XACacheException` to be thrown.

[source%nowrap,java,indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir38}/transactions/src/test/java/org/ehcache/docs/transactions/xa/XAGettingStarted.java[tag=testNonTransactionalAccess]
----

<1> First start the Bitronix transaction manager.
By default, Ehcache 3 will auto-detect it but will throw an exception during the cache manager initialization if BTM isn't started.
<2> Configure the cache manager such as it can handle transactions by having a `TransactionManagerProvider` loaded and configured to use Bitronix.
<3> Register a cache the normal way.
<4> Give it the resources you wish.
<5> Add a `XAStoreConfiguration` object to make the cache XA transactional.
You must also give the cache a unique `XAResource` identifier as some transaction managers require this.
<6> The cache is being accessed with no prior call to `transactionManager.begin()` which makes it throw `XACacheException`.

NOTE: There is one exception to that rule: the `Cache.clear()` method will always wipe the cache's contents non-transactionally.

=== XA cache with three tiers and persistence

When a cache is configured as persistent, the in-doubt transactions are preserved and can be recovered across restarts.

This INFO log informs you about that in-doubt transactions journaling is persistent too:

[listing]
----
INFO o.e.t.x.j.DefaultJournalProvider - Using persistent XAStore journal
----

Here is an example:

[source%nowrap,java,indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir38}/transactions/src/test/java/org/ehcache/docs/transactions/xa/XAGettingStarted.java[tag=testXACacheWithThreeTiers]
----

<1> First start the Bitronix transaction manager.
By default, Ehcache 3 will auto-detect it but will throw an exception during the cache manager initialization if BTM isn't started.
<2> Configure the cache manager such as it can handle transactions by having a `TransactionManagerProvider` loaded and configured to use Bitronix.
<3> Configure persistence support to enable the use of the disk tier.
<4> Register a cache the normal way.
<5> Give it the resources you want.
<6> Add a `XAStoreConfiguration` object to make the cache XA transactional.
You must also give the cache a unique `XAResource` identifier as some transaction managers require this.
<7> Begin a JTA transaction the normal way.
<8> Update the value.
<9> Commit the JTA transaction.
Other transactions can now see the changes you made to the cache and the SoR.

[[using-xml]]
== Configuring it with XML

You can create a XML file to configure a `CacheManager`, lookup a specific transaction manager and configure XA caches:

[source%nowrap,xml,indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir38}/transactions/src/test/resources/docs/configs/xa-getting-started.xml[tags=gettingStarted]
----

<1> Declare a `TransactionManagerLookup` that will lookup your transaction manager.
<2> Configure a `xaCache` cache the normal way.
<3> Configure `xaCache` as an XA cache, giving it xaCache as its unique `XAResource` ID.

In order to parse an XML configuration, you can use the XmlConfiguration type:

[source%nowrap,java,indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir38}/transactions/src/test/java/org/ehcache/docs/transactions/xa/XAGettingStarted.java[tag=testXACacheWithXMLConfig]
----

<1> The Bitronix transaction manager must be started before the cache manager is initialized.
<2> Create a URL to your XML file's location.
<3> Instantiate a `XmlConfiguration` passing it the XML file's `URL`.
<4> Using the `static org.ehcache.config.builders.CacheManagerBuilder.newCacheManager(org.ehcache.config.Configuration)`
lets you create your `CacheManager` instance using the `Configuration` from the `XmlConfiguration`.

And here is what the BitronixTransactionManagerLookup implementation looks like:

[source%nowrap,java,indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir38}/transactions/src/main/java/org/ehcache/transactions/xa/txmgr/btm/BitronixTransactionManagerLookup.java[tag=BitronixLookup]
----

<1> The `TransactionManagerLookup` interface must be implemented and the offer a `no-arg` constructor.
<2> The `lookupTransactionManagerWrapper()` method must return a `TransactionManagerWrapper` instance.
<3> Here is the check that makes sure BTM is started.
<4> The `TransactionManagerWrapper` class is constructed with both the `javax.transaction.TransactionManager` instance as well as a `XAResourceRegistryinstance`.
The latter is used to register the `javax.transaction.xa.XAResource` instances of the cache with the transaction manager using an implementation-specific mechanism.
If your JTA implementation doesn't require that, you can use the `NullXAResourceRegistryinstead`.
