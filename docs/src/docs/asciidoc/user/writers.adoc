== Introduction

endif::notBuildingForSite[]

NOTE: Ehcache 3.1 added clustering support but this is not yet compatible with _cache-through_.

This section documents the specifics behind the <<caching-patterns.adoc#cache-through,cache-through>> implementation in Ehcache 3.
Please read the linked section if you are not familiar with terms like _cache-through_, _read-through_, _write-through_ or _system of record_.

The first thing is that Ehcache merged the concepts of +read-through_ and _write-through_ behind a single interface, the `CacheLoaderWriter`.

As indicated by its API, this interface provides methods with logical grouping:

read-through::
    The `load(K)` and `loadAll(Iterable<? super K>)` methods cover the _read-through_ part of cache-through.
write-through::
    The `write(K, V)`, `writeAll(Iterable<? extends Map.Entry<? extends K, ? extends V>>)`, `delete(K)` and `deleteAll(Iterable<? super K>)` methods
    cover the _write-through_ part of cache-through.

The reasoning behind having a unified interface is that as soon as you want a _read-through_ only cache, you need to decide what to do about mutative method calls.
What happens if someone calls `put(K, V)` on the cache?
This risks making it inconsistent with the underlying system of record.

In this context, the unified interface forces you to make a choice: either no-op `write*` / `delete*` methods or throwing when mutation happens.

As for a _write-through_ only cache, we lacked the imagination to find a valid use case for it.
It remains possible by simply having no-op `load*` methods.

=== Write-behind

An additional feature provided by Ehcache is _write-behind_ where writes are made asynchronously to the backing system of record.
The way this works in Ehcache is by simply telling the system to register a wrapper around your provided `CacheLoaderWriter` implementation.

From there, you will have extra configuration options around batching and coalescing of writes.

Ehcache 3 no longer supports retry of failed writes at the write-behind wrapper level.
We believe, as the application developer and system of record owner, that you know better when a retry should happen and how.
So if you need that, make it part of your `CacheLoaderWriter` implementation.

Write-behind introduces the following concepts:

queue size::
    Indicates how many pending write operations there can be before applying back pressure on cache operations.
concurrency level::
    Indicates how many parallel processing threads and queues there will be for write behind.
    Effectively the maximum number of in-flight writes is `concurrency level * queue size`.
batching and batch size::
    Mutative operations will be grouped in _batch size_ sets before reaching the `CacheLoaderWriter`.
    When batching, the queue size is effectively the number of pending batches there can be.
    This means that the maximum number of in-flight writes becomes `concurrency level * queue size * batch size`.
coalescing::
    When batching, coalescing means that you only send the latest mutation on a per key basis to the `CacheLoaderWriter`.
maximum write delay::
    When batching, you can indicate the maximum write delay for an incomplete batch.
    After this time has elapsed, the batch is processed even if incomplete.


== Implementing Cache-Through

include::{sourcedir31}/impl/src/test/java/org/ehcache/docs/GettingStarted.java[tag=writeThroughCache]
----

<1> We register a sample `CacheLoaderWriter` that knows about the mapping `(41L -> "zero")`
<2> Since the cache has no content yet, this will delegate to the `CacheLoaderWriter`.
    The returned mapping will populate the cache and be returned to the caller.
<3> While creating this cache mapping, the `CacheLoaderWriter` will be invoked to write the mapping into the system of record.

=== Adding Write-Behind

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir31}/impl/src/test/java/org/ehcache/docs/GettingStarted.java[tag=writeBehindCache]
----

<1> For write-behind you need a configured `CacheLoaderWriter`.
<2> Additionally, register a `WriteBehindConfiguration` on the cache by using the `WriteBehindConfigurationBuilder`.
<3> Here we configure write-behind or batching with a batch size of 3 and a maximum write delay of 1 second.
<4> We also set the maximum size of the write-behind queue.
<5> Define the concurrency level of write-behind queue(s).
    This indicates how many writer threads work in parallel to update the  underlying system of record asynchronously.
<6> Enable the write coalescing behavior, which ensures that only one update per key per batch hits the
    underlying system of record.
