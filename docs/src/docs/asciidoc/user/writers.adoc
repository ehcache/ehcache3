== Write-Through Cache

<1> If you wish to use a cache in read-through/write-through caching pattern, you'll have to implement
    a `CacheLoaderWriter` and configure it.

== Write-Behind Cache

<1> A Cache can be used in write-behind pattern as well. You will have to implement a `CacheLoaderWriter` and configure it.
<2> Additionally, register a `WriteBehindConfiguration` on the Cache by using the `WriteBehindConfigurationBuilder`.
<3> Here we configure write behind with a batch size of 3 and a max wait time of 1 second.
<4> We also set the maximum size of the writebehind queue.
<5> Define the concurrency level of writebehind queue, at a time these many writer threads will update
    the  underlying resource asynchronously.
<6> Enable the write coalescing behavior, which ensures that only one update per key per batch hits the
    underlying resource.
