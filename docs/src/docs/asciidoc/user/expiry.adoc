== Introduction

As conveyed in the <<caching-concepts.adoc#data-freshness-and-expiration,_Data Freshness and Expiration_>> documentation, this is one of the key aspects of caching.
In Ehcache 3 this is addressed with the `Expiry` interface and its use in controlling the age of cache mappings.

== Configuration

Expiry is configured at the cache level, in Java or in XML:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/impl/src/test/java/org/ehcache/docs/GettingStarted.java[tag=expiry]
----

<1> Expiry is configured at the cache level, so start by defining a cache configuration,
<2> then add to it an `Expiry`, here using the predefined _time-to-live_ one, configured with the required `Duration`.

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/xml/src/test/resources/configs/docs/getting-started.xml[tags=expiry]
----

<1> At the cache level, using the predefined _time-to-live_ again.

Both Java and XML offer direct support for three types of expiry:

[horizontal]
no expiry:: this means cache mappings will never expire,
time-to-live:: this means cache mappings will expire after a fixed duration following their creation,
time-to-idle:: this means cache mappings will expire after a fixed duration following their last access time.

For Java, see `org.ehcache.expiry.Expirations` and the XSD for XML.

Read on to implement your own expiration scheme.

== Custom expiry

Support your own expiration scheme simply means implementing the `Expiry` interface:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/api/src/main/java/org/ehcache/expiry/Expiry.java[lines=21..-1]
----

The main points to remember on the return value from these methods:

[horizontal]
some `Duration`:: indicates that the mapping will expire after that duration,
`Duration.ZERO`:: indicates that the mapping is immediately expired,
`Duration.INFINITE`:: indicates that the mapping will never expire,
`null` `Duration`:: indicates that the previous expiration time is to be left unchanged, illegal at mapping creation time.

Note that you can access the details of the mapping, thus providing expiration times that are different per mapping.

Also when used from XML, Ehcache expects your expiry implementation to have a _no-arg_ constructor.

Once you have implemented your own expiry, simply configure it.

In Java:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/impl/src/test/java/org/ehcache/docs/GettingStarted.java[tag=customExpiry]
----

<1> Simply pass your custom expiry instance into the cache builder.

In XML:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/xml/src/test/resources/configs/docs/getting-started.xml[tags=customExpiry]
----

<1> Simply pass the fully qualified class name of your custom expiry.
