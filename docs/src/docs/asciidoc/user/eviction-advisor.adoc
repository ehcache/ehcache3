== Introduction

NOTE: This is an advanced topic/feature that will not be of interest to most users.

You can affect which elements are selected for eviction from the cache by providing a class that implements the
`org.ehcache.config.EvictionAdvisor` interface.

`EvictionAdvisor` implementations are invoked when Ehcache is attempting to evict entries from the cache
(in order to make room for new entries) in order to determine whether the given entry should not be considered
a good candidate for eviction.  If the eviction is advised against, Ehcache will try to honor the preference of
preserving that entry in the cache, though there is no full guarantee of such.

<1> Configure a constrained heap, as the eviction advisor is only relevant when mappings get evicted from the cache.
<2> If you want to hint the eviction algorithm to advisor against the eviction of some mappings, you have to
    configure an instance of `EvictionAdvisor`.

In this particular example, the `OddKeysEvictionAdvisor` class will advise against eviction of any key that is an odd number.
The cache is constrained to only be allowed to contain two entries, however the code has put three entries
into the cache - which will trigger capacity eviction.
By the time the cache manager gets closed, only mappings with odd keys should be left in the cache as their
prime candidacy for eviction would have been advised against.

NOTE: Eviction advise status is computed when a mapping is written to the cache.
This means that proper eviction advisor implementations are expected to be constant for a key-value pair.

NOTE: Please keep in mind that configuring an eviction advisor can slow down eviction: the more often you advise against
eviction, the harder the cache has to work to evict an element when room is required. After a certain time, if a cache
determines that the configured eviction advisor rejected too many eviction candidates, the cache can decide to completely
bypass the eviction advisor and evict anything it sees fit.
