== What are user managed caches and what do they offer?

User managed caches is a new concept introduced in Ehcache 3.
It offers the ability to create caches that are not managed by a `CacheManager`.
Hence the name of _user managed_ caches.

The objective of this feature is to satisfy cache use cases where the added complexity of a cache manager is of no added value.
Ideas are: method local caches, thread local caches or any other place where the lifecycle of the cache is shorter than the application lifecycle.

=== Limitations

As there is no longer a cache manager offering up services, the main limitation of user managed caches is that the user has to configure all required services by hand.
Of course, if you find yourself requiring plenty of services, maybe the cache manager is a better option!

=== API extensions

While a `UserManagedCache` extends `Cache`, it offers additional methods:

include::{sourcedir}/api/src/main/java/org/ehcache/UserManagedCache.java[lines=17..-1]
----

As can be seen, these methods deal with the lifecycle of the cache and need to be called explicitly.

There is also the following interface which comes into play when a user managed persistent cache is created:

== Getting started with user managed caches

=== Basic example

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/impl/src/test/java/org/ehcache/docs/UserManagedCaches.java[tag=userManagedCacheExample]
----
<1> Create a `UserManagedCache` instance, again you can either have the builder `init()` it for you, passing true or
<2> pass false and it is up to you to `UserManagedCache.init()` them, prior to using them.
<3> You can use the cache exactly as a managed cache
<4> In the same vein, a `UserManagedCache` requires you to `UserManagedCache.close()` it explicitly. If you would also use
    managed caches simultaneously, the `CacheManager.close()` operation would not impact the user managed cache(s).

=== Disk persistent example

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/impl/src/test/java/org/ehcache/docs/UserManagedCaches.java[tag=persistentUserManagedCache]
----
<1> Create the persistence service to be used by the cache for storing data on disk
<2> Pass the persistence service to the builder next to an id for the cache - note that this will make the builder produce a more specific type: `PersistentUserManagedCache`
<3> As usual, indicate here if the data should outlive the cache
<4> Closing the cache will not delete the data it saved on disk when marked as persistent.
<5> To delete the data, after closing the cache, destroy has to be explicitly invoked.

=== Cache copier example

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/impl/src/test/java/org/ehcache/docs/UserManagedCaches.java[tag=userManagedCopyingCache]
----
<1> Configure a key copier.
<2> Configure a value copier.

=== Cache serializing copier example

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/impl/src/test/java/org/ehcache/docs/UserManagedCaches.java[tag=userManagedSerializingCopyingCache]
----
<1> Configure a `SerializingCopier` as the key copier.
<2> Configure a `SerializingCopier` is the value copier.

=== Cache copier and serializer example

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/impl/src/test/java/org/ehcache/docs/UserManagedCaches.java[tag=userManagedCopyingAndSerializingCache]
----
<1> Configure a key copier.
<2> Configure a value copier.
<3> Configure a key serializer.
<4> Configure a value serializer.
<5> Configure a heap tier.
<6> Configure a off-heap tier.

By default, the heap tier stores by reference, unless a copier is configured. The other tiers must use a serializer
to copy the keys and values.

=== Cache serializing copier and serializer example

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/impl/src/test/java/org/ehcache/docs/UserManagedCaches.java[tag=userManagedSerializingCache]
----
<1> Configure a key serializer.
<2> Configure a value serializer.
<3> Configure a `SerializingCopier` is the value copier.
<4> Configure a heap tier.
<5> Configure a off-heap tier.

In this case, the heap tier is storing keys by reference since no key copier has been configured, and it is storing
values by value since a serializing copier has been configured. Such copier is going to use the configured
serializer to perform the necessary copies.
The off-heap tier will use both the key serializer as well as the value one to make its copies.

=== Write-Through Cache example

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/impl/src/test/java/org/ehcache/docs/UserManagedCaches.java[tag=userManagedLoaderWriterCache]
----
<1> If you wish to use a cache in read-through/write-through caching pattern, you'll have to implement
    `CacheLoaderWriter` and register it.

=== Cache with Eviction Advisor example

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/impl/src/test/java/org/ehcache/docs/UserManagedCaches.java[tag=userManagedEvictionAdvisorCache]
----
<1> If you want to hint the eviction algorithm to advise against the eviction of some mappings, you have to
    configure an instance of `EvictionAdvisor`.

=== Cache with Listeners example

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/impl/src/test/java/org/ehcache/docs/UserManagedCaches.java[tag=userManagedListenerCache]
----
<1> Provide ExecutorService for ordered and unordered event delivery. Note, it is required to provide either a 
    CacheEventDispatcher or ordered/unOrdered ExecutorService for proper event delivery.
<2> Provide listener configuration using CacheEventListenerConfigurationBuilder.

=== Byte Sized Cache example

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/impl/src/test/java/org/ehcache/docs/UserManagedCaches.java[tag=userManagedByteSizedCache]
----
<1> The sizing mechanism can be configured along two axis: The first one specifies the maximum number 
    of objects to traverse while walking the object graph, the second defines the maximum size of a 
    single object.
<2> Size the heap tier in bytes.
