== What are user managed caches and what do they offer?

User managed caches is a new concept introduced in Ehcache 3.
It offers the ability to create caches that are not managed by a `CacheManager`.
Hence the name of _user managed_ caches.

The objective of this feature is to satisfy cache use cases where the added complexity of a cache manager is of no added value.
Ideas are: method local caches, thread local caches or any other place where the lifecycle of the cache is shorter than the application lifecycle.

=== Limitations

As there is no longer a cache manager offering up services, the main limitation of user managed caches is that the user has to configure all required services by hand.
Of course, if you find yourself requiring plenty of services, maybe the cache manager is a better option!

=== API extensions

While a `UserManagedCache` extends `Cache`, it offers additional methods:

[source,java,indent=0]

include::{sourcedir31}/api/src/main/java/org/ehcache/UserManagedCache.java[lines=17..-1]
----

As can be seen, these methods deal with the lifecycle of the cache and need to be called explicitly.

There is also the following interface which comes into play when a user managed persistent cache is created:

== Getting started with user managed caches

=== Starting example with lifecycle

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir31}/impl/src/test/java/org/ehcache/docs/UserManagedCaches.java[tag=userManagedCacheExample]
----
<1> Create a `UserManagedCache` instance, again you can either have the builder `init()` it for you, passing true, or
<2> pass false and it is up to you to `UserManagedCache.init()` them, prior to using them.
<3> You can use the cache exactly as a managed cache
<4> In the same vein, a `UserManagedCache` requires you to `UserManagedCache.close()` it explicitly. If you also use
    managed caches simultaneously, the `CacheManager.close()` operation does not impact the user managed cache(s).

From this basic example, explore the API of `UserManagedCacheBuilder` to find all the directly available features.

The following features apply in the exact same way to user managed caches:

* <<serializers-copiers.adoc#,Serializers and copiers>>
* <<eviction-advisor.adoc#,Eviction advisor>>

Simply use the methods from `UserManagedCacheBuilder` which are equivalent to the ones from `CacheConfigurationBuilder`.

Below we will describe some more advanced setup where there is a need to maintain a service instance in order to have a working user managed cache.

=== Example with disk persistence and lifecycle

If you want to use a disk persistent cache, you will need to create and lifecycle the persistence service.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir31}/impl/src/test/java/org/ehcache/docs/UserManagedCaches.java[tag=persistentUserManagedCache]
----
<1> Create the persistence service to be used by the cache for storing data on disk
<2> Pass the persistence service to the builder as well as an id for the cache - note that this will make the builder produce a more specific type: `PersistentUserManagedCache`
<3> As usual, indicate here if the data should outlive the cache
<4> Closing the cache will not delete the data it saved on disk when marked as persistent.
<5> To delete the data, after closing the cache, destroy has to be explicitly invoked.
<6> It is also your responsibility to stop the persistence service once you are done with the cache.

=== Example with cache event listeners

Cache event listeners require executor services to work.
You will have to provide either a `CacheEventDispatcher` implementation
or make use of the default one by providing two executor services: one for ordered events and one for un-ordered ones.

NOTE: The ordered events executor must be single threaded to guarantee ordering.

For more information on cache event listeners, see <<cache-event-listeners.adoc#,the section dedicated to them>>.

----
include::{sourcedir31}/impl/src/test/java/org/ehcache/docs/UserManagedCaches.java[tag=userManagedListenerCache]
----
<1> Provide ExecutorService for ordered and unordered events delivery.
<2> Provide listener configuration using CacheEventListenerConfigurationBuilder.
