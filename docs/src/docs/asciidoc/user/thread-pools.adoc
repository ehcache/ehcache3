== Introduction

Some services work asynchronously, hence they require thread pools to perform their tasks. All thread pooling
facilities are centralized behind the `ExecutionService` interface.

== Let's start with a bit of theory

=== What `ExecutionService` provides

`ExecutionService` is an interface providing:

 * `ScheduledExecutorService` to schedule tasks, i.e.: tasks that happen repeatedly after a configurable
   delay.
 * Unordered `ExecutorService` to execute tasks as soon as a thread is available.
 * Ordered `ExecutorService` to execute tasks as soon as a thread is available, with the guarantee that tasks
   are going to be executed in the order they were submitted.

=== Available `ExecutionService` implementations

There currently are two bundled implementations:

 * `OnDemandExecutionService` creates a new pool each time an executor service (scheduled or not) is requested.
   This implementation is the default one and requires no configuration at all.
 * `PooledExecutionService` keeps a configurable set of thread pools and divides them to handle all executor service
   requests. This implementation must be configured with a `PooledExecutionServiceConfiguration` when used.

=== Configuring `PooledExecutionService`

When you want total control of the threads used by a cache manager and its caches, you have to use a
`PooledExecutionService` that itself must be configured as it does not have any defaults.

The `PooledExecutionServiceConfigurationBuilder` can be used for this purpose, and the resulting configuration it builds
can simply be added to a `CacheManagerBuilder` to switch the `ExecutionService` implementation to a
`PooledExecutionService`.

The builder has two interesting methods:

 * `defaultPool` that is used to set the default pool. There can be only one default pool, its name does not matter,
 and if thread-using services do not specify a thread pool, this is the one that will be used.
 * `pool` that is used to add a thread pool. There can be as many pools as you wish but services must explicitly be
 configured to make use of them.

=== Using the configured thread pools

Following is the list of services making use of `ExecutionService`:

 * Disk store: disk writes are performed asynchronously.
   `OffHeapDiskStoreConfiguration` is used to configure what thread pool to use at the cache level, while
   `OffHeapDiskStoreProviderConfiguration` is used to configure what thread pool to use at the cache manager level.
 * Write Behind: `CacheLoaderWriter` write tasks happen asynchronously.
   `DefaultWriteBehindConfiguration` is used to configure what thread pool to use at the cache level, while
   `WriteBehindProviderConfiguration` is used to configure what thread pool to use at the cache manager level.
 * Eventing: produced events are queued and sent to the listeners by a thread pool.
   `DefaultCacheEventDispatcherConfiguration` is used to configure what thread pool to use at the cache level, while
   `CacheEventDispatcherFactoryConfiguration` is used to configure what thread pool to use at the cache manager level.

The different builders will make use of the right configuration class, you do not have to use those classes directly.
For instance, calling `CacheManagerBuilder.withDefaultDiskStoreThreadPool(String threadPoolAlias)` is actually identical
to calling `CacheManagerBuilder.using(new OffHeapDiskStoreProviderConfiguration(threadPoolAlias))`.

The thread pool can be assigned to a service with the builders by passing a
`threadPoolAlias` parameter to the ad-hoc method. When a service isn't told anything about what thread pool to use, 
the default thread pool is used.


== In practice

Following are examples of describing how to configure the thread pools the different services will use.

=== Configuring with code

==== Disk store

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir31}/impl/src/test/java/org/ehcache/docs/ThreadPools.java[tag=diskStore]
----

<1> Configure the thread pools. Note that the default one (`dflt`) is required for the events even when no event
    listener is configured.
<2> Tell the `CacheManagerBuilder` to use a default thread pool for all disk stores that don't explicitly specify one.
<3> Tell the cache to use a specific thread pool for its disk store.

==== Write Behind

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir31}/impl/src/test/java/org/ehcache/docs/ThreadPools.java[tag=writeBehind]
----

<1> Configure the thread pools. Note that the default one (`dflt`) is required for the events even when no event
    listener is configured.
<2> Tell the `CacheManagerBuilder` to use a default thread pool for all write-behind caches that don't explicitly
    specify one.
<3> Tell the `WriteBehindConfigurationBuilder` to use a specific thread pool for its write-behind work.

==== Events

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir31}/impl/src/test/java/org/ehcache/docs/ThreadPools.java[tag=events]
----

<1> Configure the thread pools. Note that there is no default one so all thread-using services must be configured
    with explicit defaults.
<2> Tell the `CacheManagerBuilder` to use a default thread pool to manage events of all caches that don't explicitly
    specify one.
<3> Tell the `CacheEventListenerConfigurationBuilder` to use a specific thread pool for sending its events.

=== Configuring with XML

[source,xml]
----
include::{sourcedir31}/xml/src/test/resources/configs/docs/thread-pools.xml[tags=threadPools]
----

<1> Configure the thread pools. Note that there is no default one.
<2> Configure the default thread pool this cache manager will use to send events.
<3> Configure the default thread pool this cache manager will use for write-behind work.
<4> Configure the default thread pool this cache manager will use for disk stores.
<5> Configure a specific write-behind thread pool for this cache.
<6> Configure a specific thread pool for this cache to send its events.
<7> Configure a specific thread pool for this cache's disk store.
