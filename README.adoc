== Getting started with the new API

For samples, documentation, and usage information, please see http://ehcache.org.

== Current release

We released 3.2.0 on December 12th 2016.

The https://github.com/ehcache/ehcache3/releases/tag/v3.2.0[release notes] contain the links to the artifacts and the documentation to help you get started.

You should consider upgrading to 3.2.x as it does all 3.0.x and 3.1.x do and more with a fully compatible API.
The only thing to note cmopared to 3.0.x is that transactional support has been moved to a separate jar.

== Current development & next release

We are still working on the missing features of the clustering tier of Ehcache 3 which will be included in upcoming releases.
We may still do 3.1.x release to include all fixes that have been made on it, but this is now less a priority.
There is no longer any plan for a 3.0.x release.

See the https://github.com/ehcache/ehcache3/milestones[milestones on GitHub] for more details on the current status.
