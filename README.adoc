== Getting started with the new API

For samples, documentation, and usage information, please see http://ehcache.github.io.

== Current release

We released the Alpha on December 12, 2014. It
contains everything (and more) to use the JSR-107 API with Ehcache as the underlying provider.

The https://github.com/ehcache/ehcache3/releases/tag/v3.0.0.Alpha[release notes] contain the links to the documentation
to help you get started

== Current development & next release

We are now working on the next milestone, aka https://github.com/ehcache/ehcache3/milestones/OSS%20Beta[OSS Beta] :
All the work to get all the features we want to port from the existing Ehcache 2.x line, exposed using the new API.
This includes things not covered by the 107 spec, such as _WriteBehind_, _DiskPersistence_, _EvictionListener_ et al.

See the https://github.com/ehcache/ehcache3/milestones[milestones on GitHub] for more details on the current status.
