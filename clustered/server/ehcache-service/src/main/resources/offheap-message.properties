offheap.info = Allocation level of offheap resource "{}" has reached {}%. Caches reserve space up-front, and do not further deplete offheap resource availability (nor do they release space) - thus resource usage by caches will not increase unless more caches are created.
offheap.warn = Allocation level of offheap resource "{}" has reached {}%. Caches reserve space up-front, and do not further deplete offheap resource availability (nor do they release space) - thus resource usage by caches will not increase unless more caches are created.
