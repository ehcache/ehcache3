 *   A {@code Cache} is not a map, mostly because it has the following two concepts linked to mappings:
 *   <UL>

 *     evict (remove) a mapping at any point in time. Note that eviction may occur before maximum capacity is
 *     reached.</LI>
 *     <LI>Expiry: Data in a {@code Cache} can be configured to expire after some time. There is no way for a
 *     {@code Cache} user to differentiate from the API between a mapping being absent or expired.</LI>
 *   </UL>
